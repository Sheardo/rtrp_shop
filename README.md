# rtrp_shop
General shop for RDR2.
This is a fork of [RPF shop](https://github.com/cedricalpatch/rpf_generalshop) (it has been heavily changed so I'm not even sure if this is needed). It's more light weight and easier to configure.

## Requirements
[redem-roleplay](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redem_roleplay/)

[redem-roleplay](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_inventory)


## Installation
Add `ensure rtrp_shop` in server.cfg

# How to add items to the shop
Open config.lua and follow the example in the file. Super simple! 

# I have an error???
Check you haven't missed a bracket or comma in the config.
Open an issue on GitHub if that didn't help.

# Want to work on this and share it?
Go ahead! Just have a link to this repo please? :)
