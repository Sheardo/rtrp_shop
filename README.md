# rtrp_shop
General shop for RDR2.
This is a fork of [RPF shop](https://github.com/cedricalpatch/rpf_generalshop) (it has been heavily changed so I'm not even sure if this is needed). It's more light weight and easier to configure.

## Requirements
[redem-roleplay](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redem_roleplay/)

[redem-inventory](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_inventory)


## Installation
Add `ensure rtrp_shop` in server.cfg

# How to add items to the shop
Open config.lua and follow the example in the file. Super simple! 

# I have an error???
Check you haven't missed a bracket or comma in the config.
Open an issue on GitHub if that didn't help.

# Want to work on this and share it?
Go ahead! Just have a link to this repo please? :)
The RPF shop repo (which hardly relates to this now) has a GNU license so therefore, I'm legally required to have a GNU license on this as well (bs, should be open and free but oh well). So if you do redistribute this, ensure you mention the RPF repo as well as this one...
